This repository contains an automated registration form that utilizes data-driven testing using Selenium WebDriver, 
with the data being stored in an Excel file. The script reads the data from the Excel file and fills in the registration 
form accordingly, eliminating the need for manual input. This results in increased efficiency and accuracy in the registration process.
